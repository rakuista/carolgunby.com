I wrote the overview and main developer guides:

+	[Overview](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/guides)
+	[Create a form or quiz](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/guides/create-form-quiz)
+	[Update a form or quiz](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/guides/update-form-quiz)
+	[Set up quiz grading options](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/guides/setup-grading)
+	[Retrieve forms and responses](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/guides/retrieve-forms-responses)

I also built and tested most of the Python code samples based on create/retrieve samples created by Engineering, and edited all [reference documentation](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/reference/rest/v1/forms) for site style and clarity.
