Most of my work at Intuit was internal and proprietary. However, my org had a quarterly *Lean Startup*-style exercise for which I proposed and created a handout notebook. The goal was to give everyone a physical object that they could use during the 3-day event, but also afterwards as they thought of product ideas they wanted to try out. We printed 1000 copies and handed them out at each event for a year.

#### Sample (book was 36 pages with 5 experiment rounds)
